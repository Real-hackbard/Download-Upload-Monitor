A network monitoring interface card or NMIC is similar to a [network card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller) (NIC). However, unlike a standard network card, an NMIC is designed to passively (and silently) listen on a network. At a functional level, an NMIC may differ from a NIC in that the NMIC may not have a [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address), may lack the ability to transmit, and may not announce its presence on a network. Advanced NMICs have features that include the ability to offload CPU-intensive processing from a system's CPU, accurate time measurement, traffic filtering, and the ability to perform other application-specific processing.

Organizations often use a dedicated interface for all management traffic and thus create a management network. This is done to minimize the impact on production traffic, ensure the integrity of management traffic, and it helps by measuring true production traffic, not the traffic generated by the act of measuring traffic. This is a separate function from NMICs that are used for data collection and processing.

In {telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications), data rate units are commonly multiples of [bits per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate) (bit/s) and bytes per second (B/s). For example, the [data rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate) of modern residential high-speed Internet connections are commonly expressed in megabits per second (Mbit/s). They are used as units of measurement for expressing data transfer rate, the average number of bits (bit rate), characters or symbols ([symbol rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_rate)), or data blocks per unit time passing through a communication link in a data-transmission system.
